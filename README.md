Backup Manager
This is a simple Python program with a GUI that helps you back up folders and files. You can choose a source folder and a destination folder. You can also decide if you want the backup to be zipped or just copied normally. It keeps a log of all backups so you can see what happened.

How to use it:
-run main.py,
-pick the folder you want to back up,
-pick where you want the backup saved,
-check or uncheck "Zip Backup" depending on whether you want a compressed backup,
-click the Backup button,
-youâ€™ll get a popup telling you if the backup worked or failed.

Requirements:
-Python 3 (tested on 3.13)
-Tkinter (usually included with Python)

Screenshots are attached in the 'screenshots' folder showing the main window with folder selection and the backup success message popup
